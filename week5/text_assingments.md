## 3.3

Assuming that you, maybe among different plots, also did the normal q-q
plot above, the question is now: What exactly is plotted in that plot? Or
more specifically: what are the x- and y-coordinates of e.g. the two points
to the lower left in this plot?

The y coordinates in a qq plot is the raw value of the data, in this case the length / width of the beam

The x coordinates are theoretical quantiles, meaning that the middle data points will be plotted closer, and the points on the edge will be plotted further away, to simulate plottin based on quantiles

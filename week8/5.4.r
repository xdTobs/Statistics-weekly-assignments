#Can you conclude that there is a relation between the impact strength and
#the cooling time at significance level Î± = 5%?

#yes since 0 is not part of the 95% confidence interval
#and p value for the null hypothesis is 0.003

#with the usual t-test statistic for such a test, what is the range (for t) 
#within which the hypothesis is accepted?

#Should be read as find the values for t that accept the hypothesis
#meaning find critical values
